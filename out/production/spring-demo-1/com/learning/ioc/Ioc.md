#Inversion of Control
The approach of outsourcing the construction and management of objects.
Outsourcing is managed by Object factory.

Best practice - code to interface

## Spring Container
Spring container provides object factory that can help to make the app configurable
### Primary Functions
    1. Create and manage objects (IOC)
    2. Inject Object dependencies (Dependency Injection)

### Ways of configuring Spring
    1. XML configuration - legacy
    2. Java Annotations - modern
    3. Java Source Code - modern

### Spring development Process
    1. Configure spring beans
    2. Create Spring container (ApplicationContext)
    3. Retreive beans from Spring container

### Types of Dependency Injection
    1. Constructor Injection
    2. Setter Injection

    Using Autowired annotation
